## Introduction

### Meeting for first time

- Hello, this is Sa-mpEx.

### Further information

**Sa-mpEx** is open-source moduled library for SA:MP ( *San Andreas Multiplayer* ) servers/scripts. The library was written in PAWN scripting language, and originally created by DEntisT.

### What is the point?

**Sa-mpEx** brings you lot of functions and stuff to use in your gamemode script. All functions are moduled, but not separated. At first look, this library might look like something useless - but, at least someone will find it useful since it is making coding easy and interesting.

## Modules

### What are modules?

Modules are technically ordinary folders, but - they contain different files that are arranged by modules depending on their use.

Well, the * Storage * module contains functions related to storing data in files. For example, these functions are needed to create a registry and login system!

Remember that you as a user of this library do not need to include modules and libraries because they are all included together in the SAMPEX.inc file. Which means, in order to use the Sa-mpEx functions - all you need to do is include SAMPEX.inc and the configuration file:

```pawn
#include <SAMPEX.cfg>
#include <SAMPEX>
```
